        <p>Jamaica’s name is derived from the Arawak word Xaymaca which roughly translates as “Land of Wood and Water”. In May 1494, Christopher Columbus landed on the island during his second voyage to the “New World”, and claimed it for Spain. The English captured the island from the Spanish in 1655, and Jamaica went on to become an important sugar colony. Slavery was abolished in 1834, giving way to the apprenticeship system, with full Emancipation coming in 1838.

        <p>Jamaica, part of the Greater Antilles, is located in the Caribbean Sea at a latitude of 18 degrees north and a longitude of 78 degrees west (of the capital, Kingston). It is about 1127 km (700 miles) south of Miami, Florida, USA, and 145 km (90 miles) south of Cuba, its nearest neighbour. The island has an area of 11453 sq km (4411 sq miles). It is 235 km (146 miles) long from east to west, and 82 km (51 miles) across at its broadest point, from St Ann’s Bay in the north to Portland Point in the south. </P>
        <p>Jamaica is extremely mountainous, with a central chain of mountains running east to west, forming a backbone through the middle of the island. Nearly half of the island’s area is over 300 m (1000 feet) above sea level. The highest point is Blue Mountain Peak, on the border between Portland and St. Thomas, at 2256 m (7402 feet).
         </p>
         <p>Jamaica is divided into three counties – Cornwall, Middlesex and Surrey – and further divided into 14 parishes. Kingston, the capital and commercial centre of Jamaica, is situated on the southeast coast of the island. Montego Bay, located on the north-west coast, is the island’s second city. It was granted city status on May 1, 1980.
